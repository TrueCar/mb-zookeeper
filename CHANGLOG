v0.1 initial release - JRuby only

v0.2 refactor madness! - Lets Merge Zookeeper-Client C code

- merged some code from http://github.com/myelin/zookeeper_client/tree/master to move towards one API interface to support JRuby and MRI
- changed methods to support one interface
- wrapped any returned objects from JRuby to be plain old Ruby objects, e.g. Stat, WatcherEvent, ACL etc
- gemspec supports building either MRI or JRuby version
