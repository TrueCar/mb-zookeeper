== DESCRIPTION:

JRuby Interface to Yahoo's ZooKeeper http://zookeeper.wiki.sourceforge.net/


== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Work in progress -- most of the needed ZooKeeper methods have been supported.
Queue was a hacked copy from the Java Tutorial on the site --- will refactor into a useable Recipe at some point.
ACL issues exist in ZooKeeper that have been patched, but patch only seems to work on trunk (Revision 176).  See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-48

== TODO

Add support for Ruby using ZooKeeper C API's

== SYNOPSIS:

Given a running ZooKeeper server listening for a client connection on port 2181:

  zk = ZooKeeper.new(:host => "localhost:2181")
  zk.create(:path => "/test", :data => "test_data")
  
See spec/zookeeper_spec for expected use and behaviour.

== REQUIREMENTS:

ZooKeeper installed and running.

Steps I followed for the zookeeper-dev.jar included:

1. svn co https://zookeeper.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zookeeper/trunk zookeeper
2. apply patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12384350/acl_3.patch
3. cd zookeeper/zookeeper (where ant make file build.xml is)
4. ant (default target is jar)
5. zookeeper-dev.jar should be build it current directory

== INSTALL:

jruby -S gem install zookeeper-0.1.gem
